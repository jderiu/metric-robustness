1 Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work .

You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ?
2 Beneficial ? I don ' t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .	But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .	No . I don ' t . Please .|Lastly , may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ?|You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before .|Keep it and use it as rag .

Come on , I can't wait to chow down .|Cool !|If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours .|Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ?
1 Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?	Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .	Oh ? What's that ?|Why is that ?|No , I ' m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He ' s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ?|I can ' t believe these skirts are so cheap .|What do you suggest ?|Thank you very much .|Yes .

Is it in the box ? May I see it ?|I realize that now . I will do that after a while .|No , it won't .|Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ?|Yes , I can be there at 6 .|Good morning ! What can I do for you ?|Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ' m really looking to settle down .
3 Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .	Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .	Could you tell me something about your family ?|yes , good luck , Maria .|Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .|Well first you have to have more confidence .

I think we'll go straight to the table , By the way . may I check my overcoat here ?|Well , how tall is she ?|Do you have any information about the city sights ?|I wonder if you could help me , I'm looking for a room .|I got a sandwich , some chips , and a soda .|Can you tell me what time we're arriving ?|Then do the slim pills take effect on you ?|OK . I will .|This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .|You like to go to these places , don ' t you ?|Sorry , I overslept . My clock didn't go off this morning .|Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things .|May I help you ?

1 How did your company's fundraiser go ?	The fundraiser events went really well .

3 Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society .	In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company .

We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .	Please sit down .|Yes . Can I help you ?|Then , why didn't you do that ?|That sounds simple enough . Do you charge any admin fees for that ?|Hello , this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank .

They sell them here for about that .|Thank you , goodbye .|You get five paid sick days .|Then what ?|I ' ll remember that for next time .
