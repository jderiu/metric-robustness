1 Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?	Sure . First of all , it ' s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ' t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .	It sure is .|How silly of you to jump out of the window !|That's wonderful ! I like swimming .|Since we have reached an agreement on all terms , there shouldn't be any problems for the contract .|What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great .|But you should have told me you were in love with her .|Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system .|I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .|It happened at my house .|That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?|Just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you'll find it on your right .|You're right .|My name is Jung Min . What's your name ?|I'm Du Juan , in Room 312 .|Don ' t worry . There ' s plenty of time yet .
2 Yeah , that's very important .	So you ' d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .	B :: Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson .|I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00|Today I want to invite you to talk about insurance you ' re interested in .|And the holdall has some fragile items inside , so please be careful with that too .|Sure , that sounds good .|That's right . It's over there .|We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ?|She does have a heart of gold .|What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today .|you mean if they catch the murderer . I ' m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .|Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... I can't keep them all straight !|I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value . The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week .|Yes , of course . But I'm afraid I can't tell you .|can I buy stamps here ?|Where do I put the change ?
3 I ' ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .	That ' s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .	Excellent ! That sounds like a plan .|and the bubble wrap ?|You can take an antihistamine .|Just point to it if you don't know the name .|Well , as the saying goes -- we aim to please !|But if I don't pass , will you call me ?|I'd like some grapefruit juice , marmalade , two scrambled eggs with two sausages , toast , and a pot of black coffee , please . How long will it take ?|I'd like the roast chicken , please .|Can you tell me more ?|I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice .|Oh , yes , I would !|I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ' d love to go with you .|Yeah , it's hard to believe but true .|Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious !|Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes .
4 It ' s always easier to say something than to do it .	It ' s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .	Do you have the statement for your card ?|Yes , I would .|I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00|Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ?|You can only miss one class without penalty .|Thanks so much .|We're thinking about going to America .|Go ahead .|Oh , yeah . Oulong tea is good for one's health . isn't it ?|You do ?|What kind are you thinking of getting ?|We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .|what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ?|Then when will I get a reply at the latest ?|ok . You haven ' t seen my company car , have you ?
5 But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .	I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .	I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position .|You can take it in a couple weeks .|Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign .|Oh , that ' s interesting , and but what kind of things ?|What ' s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?|Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that .|No . I can't paint . I'm asking for my niece . She is really into it .|I think the red one fits me well . Can I try it on ?|you mean if they catch the murderer . I ' m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .|All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .|Excuse me , may I help you ?|Good morning , Angela , how have you been lately ?|Yes , I am the guy .|Promise that you won't get angry .|twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .
6 It ' s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .	You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .	Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks .|Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes .|that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .|All right . Thank you .|I mostly did advertising planning .|Sorry , I forgot . I don ' t like seafood , neither .|Good morning . Craftsman Company . Can I help you ?|I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is .|Yes , it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him .|Thank you .|Mary , it's good to see you !|Yes , I've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour . Where are they ?|I ' m not kidding .|Just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line .|They said I need a new hard drive .
7 I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .	You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .	My mother-in - law . She retired last year .|I understand your position .|Well , it depends on the price , of course . What is it ?|Definitely not . The most important thing was we loved each other .|No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ?|And this one ? Too flashy ?|My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him .|I already have something to wear .|I ' m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other .|How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ?|Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer .|Sure . What's up ?|Have you ever read this book before ?|Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ?|How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
8 It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .	It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .	Where do you want to go ?|Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on .|So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market .|Hello ?|No , that's 447-9626 .|We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine .|my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate .|No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there .|I sure do .|It's ten after six . We ' re late . But dinner is at six thirty .|You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw .|No , thank you . Check , please .|you ' d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days .|Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .|Excuse me . How much is the chocolate bar ?
1 The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?	No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .	All right , Mr . Cook . I'll have Mr . Baker call you back as soon as he gets here .|But Mrs . Smith hired him to find her lost son .|911 emergency . What is the problem ?|I ' m thinking about it . How much is it ?|Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet .|It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .|The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective .|Yes . I'll have the shrimp cocktail to start .|I am doing great ! Thank you for asking , Joe .|Good afternoon , how may I help you ?|Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner .|Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ?|I wonder if you can change it to one size down .|are you doing anything this weekend ?|Certainly . Here it is .
2 It better be more than last year .	Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .	How upsetting ! He has been away for a week !|If you need to work overtime , you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay .|It sure is .|No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .|Two suitcases and a handbag . The suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red .|Hello , I scheduled an appointment with Dr . Smith , and I can ' t make it on that day .|What can I show you ?|What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ?|As a teacher , I don ' t know how to help him .|Thanks .|Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .|Honey , I don ' t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .|Thank you !|Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate .|I hear that the kitchen is quite large . Let ' s go check it out .
1 I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed .	What a pity !	Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?|Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .|Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21 . 50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ' s free !|Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ?|Right , I see . Let me give you another 500 RIB .|Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ?|Yes , I think I can in ordinary circumstances .|Why don't you watch where you're going ?|Do you want to know what kind of pie I like ?|I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now .|Ye , I hope so . well . Take it easy .|Well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking .|First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations .|Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ?|I ' m afraid I spoke in all of the table clock .
2 If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ?	That's OK .	Gave me the receipt , please .|there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes .|Good morning , Sir .

2 Where did you want to go for lunch ?	I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria .	I think what you wear is so overrated .

3 I don't think I ever got food from the cafeteria .	I actually like the food there .	Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .|How do you do ?|Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .|What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?|Any rain ?|But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .|Yes , Mr .

But she disagrees with me about everything .|I've never gotten one . Have you ?|That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there .|Here you are .

5 I was thinking about getting some Chinese food .	I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . It tasted great .	Sorry , sir . It's the sale price .|OK .|In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application .|I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .|Thank you . I'm sure you will .|Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation .|Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .|Yes . We ' Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though .

4 That's a good idea .	First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers .

1 So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...	No , there's a definite difference .

That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .	Well , your word overrules the file , sir .

2 No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .

What about you ?
2 You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us .

2 What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great .	I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ?

I have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co . Ltd .|well , I can ' t just imagine it .|Do you have a medium in the same color ?

5 The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go .	That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars .

Did you get any honors or awards at your university ?|My children can never be obedient even if I criticized them severely .|You just can ' t imagine !

Be careful , it ' s still quite hot .|No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO -- the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors .

But then he came in too .|Wait , there ' s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ' ?

4 The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .	I see . I think I ' d agree with that statement .

2 Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .	It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy .

I ' m all set . Good-bye .
