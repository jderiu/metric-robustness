A bunch of fruit flies appeared in my apartment out of nowhere the other day. I think it's because of some old veggies in my fridge. Totally gross.</s>Oh man, those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere!

They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.
